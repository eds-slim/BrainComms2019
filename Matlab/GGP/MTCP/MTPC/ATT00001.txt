My networks are derived from structural data (DTI tractography) and I'm comparing global graph parameters (in particular characteristic path length and global efficiency) between Tourette patients and controls. Since any difference between groups appears to be restricted to a fairly small range of thresholding parameters, I think mtpc might be helpful in quantifying the significance of the difference.
